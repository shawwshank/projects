HashTable:

Can add and look up GPA of student in directory using Hash Tables. We also have to read data from a file and 
find the number of occurences of a certain word and sort it in O(n) time.

Sorting:

Reads names from input file and counts occurence of each name and sorts in O(nlog(n)). 
The first line contains n and t, and the next n lines contain the n numbers x1, x2, ..... xn, in no particular order. 
The goal is to find out whether there are two numbers xi,xj among the n numbers such that xi + xj = t.
